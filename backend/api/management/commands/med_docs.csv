Pamphlets & Brochures,Brain Train Poster,"Alzheimer’s Disease is a major public health challenge that affects bothpatients and caregivers in the United States. Despite this, the latestFDA approved drug entered the market in 2002, and recruitment andparticipation have been noted as barriers to further drug development.Minority populations experience a large burden of Alzheimer’s Disease;however, interventions are often delayed and their representation inclinical research is low.• EMPaCT was an NIH funded project that aimed to enhance minoritypopulation in cancer focused clinical trials. The data suggested thatstrengthening community engagement through an educational programmay serve as an effective tool to engage minorities in clinical trials andthat lack of knowledge and awareness of clinical trials is a stronginhibitor of enrollment.• We developed an educational program called Brain Train following thesuggestions from the EMPaCT study with aims of increasing theenrollment of minority populations in Alzheimer’s Diseases focusedstudies.An educational program called Brain Train was developed and ispresented to multicultural communities with participants of at least 50years of age throughout Western New York (WNY). The presentationcontains three educational segments: segment 1 is on healthy aging brainand lifestyle recommendations, segment 2 is on the importance of earlydiagnosis, and segment 3 is on the clinical trial process, risks, andbenefits. The primary outcome measure is percent change in respondingyes to “Would you be interested in participating in a clinical trial?” beforeand after segment 3. The secondary outcome measure and exploration ofbarriers is measured by the Research Attitude Questionnaire (RAQ) whichis a 7-item, 5-point scale questionnaire. Demographic informationincluding age, race, gender, socioeconomic status, and educationalattainment is collected. Linear regression models were built fordemographic variables as predictors of response outcomes. RAQ itemswere compared between demographic groups using t-tests.Linear Regression Model for “Yes” Answers After Segment 3Compared to Participant Demographics. Comparison of Participants’ Willingness to Participate in ClinicalTrials Before and After Segment 3. Three sessions with 43 participants were completed togenerate the pilot dataset. 63.15% of individuals answeredyes before segment 3 and 43.58% answered yes after,demonstrating an 19.57% decrease in clinical trialparticipation interest after the educational session. Theanswer “yes” after the educational session had the highestcorrelation with race (p=.005; Black less interested thanwhite) and gender (p=.04; female less interested thanmale) with the gap increasing after the educationalsession. Socioeconomic status, educational level, and agewere not correlating with interest to participate. ItemizedRAQ data demonstrated trust (p=.015) as a primary barrierto research participation for Black participants in this pilotdataset. Interestingly, Black participants felt higherresponsibility to volunteer (p=.008) indicating that once thetrust is created, they are likely to participate. From the first three events, education does notappear to be sufficient to increase clinical trialenrollment for underrepresented populations.Instead, trust appears to be the most significantbarrier. Therefore, trust building strategies shouldbe explored to answer this research question. Wewill continue to collect data in a clusterrandomization data trial from a total of 18 sessions. We will expand the project in a cluster randomizationdesign using 3 types of Brain Train sessionsalternating in segment 3. One type will includesegment 3, one type will include segment 3 with a laycommunity health worker, and one type will not includesegment 3. Audiences that do not receive segment 3will instead view a recap video of the healthy lifestyleinformation with a brief introduction to clinicalresearch. This will allow us to further determinewhether education about clinical trials is sufficient toincrease minority enrollment in clinical trials and if thepresence of a peer will increase trust amongunderrepresented populations."

Brain Health Just like any other organ in our body, we want to keep our brain healthy. But how do we do that? 1. Physical Exercise “A sound mind in a sound body” Exercise has been shown to not only keep your heart healthy, but also your brain healthy. 2. Mental Exercise Keep your brain on a training schedule. Use brain teasers to maintain brain connections and build more. Also, socialize! Socializing is good for your brain. 3. Sleep and Meditation Give your brain enough time to rest at night. Getting a good night’s sleep keeps your brain fresh and active. It also can help to keep your stress level down. 4. Nutrition Keeping a well-balanced diet can help lower the risk of developing memory problems. Normal Aging versus Memory Problems As we age, our memory might not be as sharp as when we were younger. But how can we tell normal brain aging from early signs of dementia? Your loved ones could have early signs of dementia if they: 1. Have more difficulty remembering appointments and family events 2. Are repeating themselves more frequently (for example, asking the same questions again over a short period of time) 3. Have more difficulty expressing or remembering words 4. Have trouble with decision making such as paying bills 5. Get lost in a familiar place or on a familiar route These could be early signs of dementia and you may want to consider a visit to the neurologist for a check-up. Alzheimer’s Disease Alzheimer’s Disease is a brain disorder that involves the loss of brain cells over time. Common symptoms include a decline in memory and thinking skills. Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive disease which means it gets worse over time. As time passes, a person’s brain functioning will decline. Luckily, there are some treatments that slow down progression of the disease. An early diagnosis can help to maintain the best quality of life for patients and their caregivers."

Tau PET scans are used to measure the deposition of tau. Tau deposition in the brain is the second core pathology (abnormal protein), besides Abeta amyloid, that is thought to be associated with increased risk of developing symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The information from the tau PET scans will be used to understand if gantenerumab can stop the spread of tau in the brain compared to placebo, and how this may influence Alzheimer’s disease progression. You will undergo tau PET scans before the first dose of study drug at the start of the study, then during visits at Weeks 105, 157, 211, and, if your thinking abilities worsen significantly (to the point where you would be diagnosed with MCI or dementia) and you are being started on gantenerumab study treatment, a tau PET scan will be done before the start of the study treatment if your prior tau PET scan is older than 6 months.

This research study evaluates whether a novel investigational treatment, gantenerumab, can prevent or slow the development of symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease in people who are at risk for or at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. • F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (hereafter referred to as “Roche”) is the Sponsor of this study and is paying the study site to cover the costs of this study. • This Consent Form tells you what will happen if you take part as a study partner. It also tells you about the possible benefits and risks of being in the study as a study partner. • Taking part in this study is your choice. Please read the information carefully and feel free to ask questions. It may be helpful for you to discuss this information with your family and friends. • Instead of participating in this study, you may choose not to take part. • If you decide to take part in this study as study partner, you will be asked to sign and date this Consent Form. You will be given a copy of your signed and dated Consent Form. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 2 of 9 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 25 Feb 2022 Revised 9 Mar 2022 1.2 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY? The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good or bad, of gantenerumab with those of placebo (inactive substance) in participants who are at risk for or at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. The target number of participants who will take part in this study is 1200. Gantenerumab is an investigational drug, which means health authorities like the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not approved gantenerumab for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. While gantenerumab has been, and is being tested in participants with prodromal to mild Alzheimer’s disease as well as in younger individuals with a familial form of the disease, it has not been tested in older participants who are at risk for or at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease prior to this study. Study WN42444 investigates whether gantenerumab can prevent or slow the development of symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease in individuals who are at risk for or in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. 1.3 WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I PARTICIPATE? The entire study will take approximately 4 years and 9 months to complete and it consists of three main parts: 1. The screening period necessary to assess if this study is right for the study participant who may be at risk for, or at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease and to provide informed consent) 2. The study treatment period during which the study participant will receive study drug 3. The safety follow-up period necessary to check on the participant after study treatment with the study drug is complete During the study treatment period, the participant will get either gantenerumab or placebo. A placebo looks like a drug but has no active ingredient. The participant will have a 50% chance of receiving gantenerumab. The assignment to the gantenerumab or the placebo group will be decided by chance (like tossing a coin). Neither you, the participant, or the study doctor can know the group the participant is in. However, the study doctor can find out which group the participant is in, if their safety is at risk. Your active support of the participant and your long-term commitment throughout the study will be key factors contributing to the successful outcome of this study. This will include approximately 11 visits to the study site. Visits may last approximately 1−4.5 hours. The activities that will require your time and help are as follows: • Accompany the participant to some of the visits. • Make a note of any health-related and illness-related changes experienced by the participant between visits (including side effects) and report them at each visit you attend. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 3 of 9 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 25 Feb 2022 Revised 9 Mar 2022 • Complete or answer questionnaires during some study visits related to cognitive function, daily activities, and quality of life of the participant. Please note that some of these interviews may be audio recorded and sent to qualified reviewers (acting on behalf of Roche) for quality assurance purposes. It will take you, the study partner, 35−75 minutes to complete these assessments depending on the visit. • You may be asked to administer the study drug to the participant by an injection under the skin in the abdomen. This will have to be performed on a regular basis, according to the participant ́s schedule, at the participant’s home or another suitable location. If you choose to administe"

F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 34 of 41 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 9 Feb 2022 Revised 9 Mar 2022 CONSENT FOR OPTIONAL LONGITUDINAL TAU PET You are now being asked to undergo additional optional tau PET scans as part of Study WN42444. Tau PET scans are used to measure the deposition of tau. Tau deposition in the brain is the second core pathology (abnormal protein), besides Abeta amyloid, that is thought to be associated with increased risk of developing symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The information from the tau PET scans will be used to understand if gantenerumab can stop the spread of tau in the brain compared to placebo, and how this may influence Alzheimer’s disease progression. You will undergo tau PET scans before the first dose of study drug at the start of the study, then during visits at Weeks 105, 157, 211, and, if your thinking abilities worsen significantly (to the point where you would be diagnosed with MCI or dementia) and you are being started on gantenerumab study treatment, a tau PET scan will be done before the start of the study treatment if your prior tau PET scan is older than 6 months. For women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation), a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to every tau PET. Potential Risks Associated with the Tau PET Tracer MK-6240 There are no side effects associated with the tau PET tracer MK-6240 as provided by the manufacturer. However, there may be side effects that are not known at this time. Potential side effects include pain and bleeding from the insertion of a flexible and sterile thin plastic tube, or catheter, into a blood vessel to provide an effective method of delivering MK-6240, or a reaction to the intravenous infusion (slow injection of MK-6240 into the vein). The tau tracer contains a small amount of ethanol (alcohol) and salt. The salt content of the injected solution is the same as the salt concentration in your blood. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 35 of 41 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 9 Feb 2022 Revised 9 Mar 2022 Potential Risks Associated with the Tau PET Procedures Procedures with Associated Risks Procedure Approximate Timing Potential Risks • PET scan for tau, which may take place in a different hospital: an imaging test that will last about 30 minutes • CT scan: an X- ray test that gives off radiation that will help position your head in the PET scanner • PET scans for tau will be performed at your first visit in the study, and at Weeks 105, 157, 211, and, if your thinking abilities worsen significantly (to the point where you would be diagnosed with MCI or dementia) and you start post- progression dose escalation, a PET scan for tau will be performed before the start of the study treatment if your prior scan was performed more than 6 months ago, or if you leave the study early • CT scan with every PET scan • The total radiation exposure of the PET/CT scans will be less than or equal to the exposure that is allowed for medical radiation workers. Although there are no proven harmful effects from the radiation, no one can say for certain that there are no long-term harmful effects of radiation exposure. • Lying still for the scans may be uncomfortable • Injection of a radioactive positron emission tomography (PET) tracer into a vein in your arm before each tau PET scan • 1-2 hours before every PET scan • Please see “Potential risks associated with tau PET tracer MK-6240” • On rare occasions, the needle can cause bleeding, a blood clot, swelling, or infection at the place where the needle is inserted You will not receive any direct benefit from undergoing a tau PET scan. However, information from this procedure may benefit others who are at risk for developing symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease or a similar condition in the future. You will not be paid for taking part in longitudinal tau PET scans. Undergoing a tau PET scan is your choice. No matter what you choose, it will not affect your participation in the main study or the regular care you receive from your doctors. Undergoing these additional PET scans may require additional visits to hospital, as described earlier in this document. F.

Collection of samples may be tested by researchers during Study WN42444 and for future research. Reasons for testing may include: • Finding out why certain people are more likely to respond to treatments than others • Finding out how and why diseases act differently in different people • Developing new treatments for diseases or medical conditions • Finding out why certain people are more likely to have side effects than others • Finding out how treatments are processed in the body • Finding out how treatments affect the body • Developing better ways for preventing diseases or treating diseases earlier • Developing or improving tests or tools that help with detecting or understanding diseases and identifying the right medicine for the right participant You are being asked to donate leftover biomarker samples (blood, plasma, including samples collected at prescreening, if you participated), and CSF samples to the RBR. Roche is planning to collaborate with external research entities (for example, the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias [NCRAD] and the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute [ATRI]). A portion of the leftover prescreening (if you participated) and screening plasma and CSF samples may also be donated to these external research entities (for example, NCRAD, ATRI) for research. Donating your samples to the RBR and external research entities (for example, NCRAD, ATRI) is your choice. No matter what you choose, it will not affect your participation in the main study or the regular care you receive from your doctors. Alongside samples, the information collected from you may also be shared with the external research entities, but only after personal information that can identify you has been removed. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 38 of 41 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 9 Feb 2022 Revised 9 Mar 2022 WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I PARTICIPATE? Listed below are the procedures for donating samples, along with any potential risks. Procedure Potential Risks Leftover (unused) blood, plasma and CSF samples that were collected during prescreening, screening and during the study will be donated as above There are no additional risks associated with donating your leftover samples Samples will be securely stored in the RBR and external research entities (for example, NCRAD, ATRI) until they are no longer needed or until they are used up, and will then be destroyed. Testing may involve analysis of your genome (DNA and RNA), the ""instruction book"" for the cells in your body. Your samples may be tested for inherited or non-inherited genome variations, to allow for exploration of broad health research questions across disease areas. Testing may include analysis of all of your DNA (whole genome sequencing) or analysis of part of your DNA and RNA. Analyses of samples from a large number of people may help researchers learn more about: • Gantenerumab and similar drugs, • Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases, • Possible links among diseases, mutations and how they might affect a disease or a person's response to treatment, and • New avenues for drug development and personalized therapies. ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO DONATING SAMPLES? You will not receive any direct benefit from donating your samples. However, information from this procedure may benefit others who are at risk for or at the earliest stage of Alzheimer’s disease, or are with MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease or a similar condition in the future. WILL I BE PAID IF I DONATE SAMPLES? You will not be paid for donating samples to the RBR and external research entities (for example, NCRAD, ATRI). Information from research on your RBR samples may lead to discoveries, inventions, or development of commercial products. You and your family will not receive any benefits or payment if this happens. HOW WILL MY PRIVACY BE PROTECTED? Your samples and information will be labeled with your participant ID number; they will not be labeled with your name, your picture, or any other personally identifying information. Your samples and information will be kept under the same level of privacy used for the main study. Roche uses many safeguards to protect your privacy. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 39 of 41 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 9 Feb 2022 Revised 9 Mar 2022 Information from the analyses will not be given to your insurance company or employer, unless required by law. If the research results are published in a medical journal or presented at a scientific meeting, you will not be identified. Information from the sample analyses will not be part of your medical record. Roche, Roche affiliates, and Roche's collaborators and licensees may study the RBR samples and information in any country worldwide. Data from analysis of RBR samples may be shared with researchers or government agencies, but only after personal information that can identify you has been removed. These data may be combined with or linked to other data and used for research purposes, to advance science and public health, or for analysis, development, testing, and commercialization of products that treat or diagnose disease, or improve participant care. These data will not include information that identifies you. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you on the basis of your genetic information. This act generally will protect you in the following ways: • Health insurance companies and group health plans cannot request your genetic information from this research • Health insurance companies and group health plans cannot use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums • Employers with 15 or more employees cannot use your genetic information from this research when setting the terms of your employment This federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. WILL I HAVE ACCESS TO MY TEST RESULTS? Information from the sample analyses will not be shared with you or your doctor, unless required by law, except as described below. You may request access to the genome sequencing data obtained from your blood sample, if permitted by local law. You must submit any request for access to such sequencing data to your study doctor. This information shared with you and your study doctor may be available in the form of a file of raw genomic sequencing data. This file will not contain any interpretation of your data, and no clinical report will be available. The data will not be included in your medical record. Your blood sample may be tested many years after the study has ended, or may never be tested. This means your genomic sequencing data may not be available at the time of your request, or may never be available. Roche will do its best to forward available data, but there is no guarantee that data will be forwarded in response to every request. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 40 of 41 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 9 Feb 2022 Revised 9 Mar 2022 CAN I CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT STORING MY SAMPLES IN THE RBR? You can change your mind at any time. If you want to withdraw your consent for the RBR, tell your study doctor that you no longer want your samples stored or used for research. After you withdraw consent, any samples that remain will be destroyed. If you change your mind and your samples have already been tested, Roche and the external research entities will still be able to use the results from those tests. If you withdraw or discontinue from the main study, your RBR samples will continue to be stored and used for research unless you specifically ask that they be destroyed.

INTRODUCTION The blood samples you provide during the prescreening process are valuable even if you do not enroll in Study WN42444 in the end. Leftover prescreening blood samples can be used in additional research aimed to further our understanding of the Alzheimer’s disease biology, and advance the methodology used to improve future testing options for Alzheimer’s disease diagnostics. Roche is planning to collaborate with external research entities for example, the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD) and the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI) for long-term storage of blood samples. Leftovers of your prescreening blood samples may be made available also to these external entities for future research on Alzheimer’s disease. Alongside samples, the information collected from you may also be shared with the external research entities, but only after personal information that can identify you has been removed. 1.2. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I PARTICIPATE? Listed below are the procedures for donating samples, along with any potential risks. Procedure Potential Risks Leftover (unused) blood samples that were collected during the prescreening will be donated to the Roche repository and may be shared with external research entities (for example, NCRAD, ATRI). There are no additional risks associated with donating your leftover samples to the Roche repository and external research entities (for example, NCRAD, ATRI). If you consent to extended use of the prescreening blood samples, your blood samples will be securely stored for up to 15 years after the final results of Study WN42444 have been reported, and will then be destroyed. 1.3. ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO DONATING SAMPLES? You will not receive any direct benefit from donating your samples. However, information from this procedure may benefit others who are at risk for or at the earliest stages of AD, or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia due to AD or a similar condition in the future. 1.4. WILL I BE PAID IF I DONATE SAMPLES? You will not be paid for donating samples to Roche and external research entities (for example, NCRAD, ATRI).

Your taking part in this study is entirely voluntary. This form is called an “Informed Consent Form.” It describes your role as a study partner in the study. The study doctor or study team will go over the information in this form with you more closely. Study partners play a crucial role in this research study. Please carefully consider what is being asked of you in this Consent Form, and only agree to participate if you are confident that you can meet all of the requirements. After the research study begins, if you become unable to personally do what is required, please notify the study doctor or study team immediately. If you have any questions about the study or if you do not understand something in this form, you should ask the study doctor. Please take the time to read the following information carefully and feel free to discuss it with others. Do not sign and date this Consent Form unless your questions have been answered, and you decide that you want to be part of this study. If you wish to take part in the study, you will need to read and sign and date this Consent Form. Green Valley (Shanghai) Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Sponsor) is the pharmaceutical company sponsoring and paying for this study. This clinical research study will be conducted at about 200 sites in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region and will include about 2046 participants with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and their study partners. Green Valley (Shanghai) Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd / Protocol Number GV971-007 Page 2 of 10 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 21 Jan 2022 Revised 21 Jan 2022 What is the purpose of the study? A clinical research study is a medical investigation designed to answer specific questions about potential new drugs. All potential new drugs must be tested in clinical research studies before they can be prescribed by doctors. Without clinical research studies, no new drugs could be developed, and few medical advances would be made. Taking part in a clinical research study is completely voluntary and if you decide to take part, your participation will be kept confidential (private). You can choose not to take part in the study if you wish, and you can stop taking part at any time without giving a reason. Study participants have been invited to take part in the study because they are between the ages of 50 and 85 years and have been diagnosed with AD. The current available treatments for AD help to improve symptoms for a short time. Therefore, there is a need for an AD treatment that works for a long period. The purpose of the current study is to further see how well the study drug (GV-971) works to treat AD symptoms, and whether it causes any side effects. The study will also help to look at the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the study drug when taken as capsules in daily doses of 900 mg. Pharmacokinetics look at how the body: • Takes the drug into the blood • Delivers the drug through the blood • Breaks down or processes the drug • Removes the drug from the body The study will further see how the process works by which GV-971 helps to treat AD symptoms. What this study will involve for you is further explained in the section below “How many study visits do you need to attend?” and “What will you have to do during the study visits?”. What drug is being tested? Sodium oligomannate (GV-971) is being developed by Green Valley (Shanghai) Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. for the treatment of AD and is approved in China for the treatment of mild to moderate AD. GV-971 is made from seaweed called brown algae. A specific sugar contained within seaweed suppresses certain bacteria contained in the gut, which can cause harm to the brain, leading to AD. The study drug will be compared with placebo. A placebo is a study drug look-alike with no active drug. Taking placebo is the same as not taking anything for AD. GV-971 and placebo are both called together “study drug” in this form. The study participant will be randomly assigned (by chance) and will have a 50% (1 in 2) chance to receive one of the following: • GV-971 (900 mg"

Consents,RESEARCH PARTICIPANT CONSENT FORM,"RESEARCH PARTICIPANT CONSENT FORM Sports, Physical Activity, and the Well-being of Rural and Urban Girls Purpose of Research The purpose of this project is to learn about what makes it easy and hard to participate in programs like the Boys and Girls Club Program. Specific Procedures You and your child will each separately participate in one 30-45 minute focus group conversation. You and your child will be asked to talk about your experiences in the program, how you found out about the program and your thoughts about the program and other physical activity programs in your community. We will also ask you and your child how the program might be made better. You have the right to look at all research material prior to you and your child participating in the interview. Duration of Participation No more than 45 minutes on one occasion. Risks Risks of participation are no more than you and your child would have in everyday life. In rare instances, you or your child may be uncomfortable with answering the questions. However, because we want to learn from you and your child, there is no such thing as a “right” or “wrong” opinion or comment. Also, you or your child are free to skip questions or to leave the group at any time. Another risk common to most research is breach of confidentiality – which means that someone could find out that you were part of this study and what you said. Please read the confidentiality section below to learn how we make the risk of that very low. Benefits You and your child may not benefit right away from this study. The information that you share may help make programs like this better and might help community leaders and researchers learn how to better design activity programs for girls in your community and communities elsewhere. Compensation Your family will receive a $30 gift card for Walmart for participating in this study. Confidentiality We will be recording your voices with a digital audio recorder. The researchers will ask that participants keep the discussion confidential, but we cannot guarantee that other people in the group will not share what a participant said. Only Dr. Cadzow’s research team will have access to these recordings and hardcopy transcripts. Real names will be replaced with fake names in transcripts and any research reports and only first names will be used in digital recordings. A list matching real names with fake names and all other research data will be kept with the results. These items will be stored in locked file cabinets and password-protected computers contained in a locked room at D’Youville College. Finally, please note that the project's research records may be reviewed by departments at D’Youville College responsible for overseeing research. The results of this research will be reported in academic publications and research reports for professionals working with youth programs. A report will also be shared with the participants in the study. You will not be identified in these reports. We welcome any feedback you have on these reports."

When the participant cannot legally consent to take part, pronouns “you” and “your” should be read as referring to the participant rather than the person (legally authorized representative) who is signing this form for the participant. In cases where the participant’s representative gives consent, the participant should be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. During the course of the study, if the participant regains the capacity to consent, informed consent will be obtained from the participant and the participant offered the ability to leave the study if desired. Why are mobile nursing visits being performed? You are being asked if you would like to take part in mobile nursing visits as part of Study WN42444. Instead of coming to the clinic for all visits, a mobile nurse can visit you at your home or at another suitable location to make it easier for you to participate in this study. This service is optional, and you are free to decide whether or not to take part in mobile nursing visits. This document tells you what will happen if you take part in mobile nursing visits, to allow you to make an informed decision. No matter what you decide, it will not affect your participation in the main study or your medical care. Everything in the main study consent form you signed and dated before still applies to your participation in this study unless otherwise noted in this form. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 2 of 4 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 9 Feb 2022 Revised 9 Mar 2022 How will mobile nursing visits be planned and organized? Your study doctor will advise you on the visits for which mobile nursing services can be provided. A mobile nursing company hired by Roche will talk with study staff and arrange for a qualified nurse, trained on the study procedures, to provide mobile nursing services on the specified dates and times. The mobile nursing company may work with local nursing agencies to find a qualified mobile nurse. The study staff will provide the mobile nursing company with your information (such as your name, address, and contact information). The mobile nursing company will contact you to arrange a study-compliant visit schedule that is convenient for you based on instructions from your study doctor. If for any reason you cannot make this visit, please contact the study doctor immediately, and the study doctor will work with the mobile nursing company to make alternative arrangements for the visit. What will happen if I take part? If you agree to take part, the mobile nurse may perform the following tests or procedures during the visit: • Administration of study drug, which will be delivered to you by the mobile nurse or will be delivered directly to your home (e.g., by mail or courier) The mobile nurse will give you one or two injection(s) of study drug under the skin in your abdomen, as per the study dosing schedule and the dose regimen you have chosen. This is called a subcutaneous injection. The mobile nurse will stay with you for at least 1 hour to make sure you are okay and do not have any problems. • Measure your vital signs (heart rate and blood pressure) • Ask questions about any symptoms you may have experienced since the previous study drug administration visit • Review of any changes in your medications since the previous study drug administration visit The average duration of a mobile nursing visit is approximately 1 and a half to 2 hours. Can I stop taking part in mobile nursing visits? Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. If you want to withdraw your consent for mobile nursing visits, tell your study doctor that you no longer want to participate. Your study doctor may also decide to stop your mobile nursing visits if it is in your best interest (for example, if your study doctor needs to see you more frequently in person to monitor your health status). F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 3 of 4 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 9 Feb 2022 Revised 9 Mar 2022 What are the possible side effects or risks? The risks associated with tests or procedures performed at the mobile nursing visits are described in the main Consent Form (see ""What are the possible side effects or risks of being in the study?""). Mobile nursing services are not equipped to handle serious health emergencies at the same level as a hospital or clinic. However, the mobile nurse will be properly trained to manage in the best possible way health concerns that might occur to participants during the visit. Are there benefits to taking part? There is no guarantee that you will receive any benefits from participation in this study or from mobile nursing visits. Taking part in mobile nursing visits may be more convenient for you and may decrease the amount of travel needed for you to take part in this study. What other choices do I have if I do not take part in mobile nursing visits? You may choose to undergo all tests and procedures at the clinic, according to the study visit schedule. Will I be paid if I take part in mobile nursing visits? You will not be paid for your participation in mobile nursing visits. Will it cost me anything to take part in mobile nursing visits? Roche will pay for the costs of the mobile nursing services. There are no costs to you or to your health plan for mobile nursing visits. How will my privacy be protected? Your personal information (such as your name, address, and contact information) will be shared with the mobile nursing company or any company acting on their behalf, such as a courier, and the mobile nurse to allow them to make arrangements for the mobile nursing visits. The mobile nurse will collect and record information about you during each visit. This information will include medical and personal information about you, such as information about your general health, how you have responded to study drug, any side effect you may have experienced, and results of any testing performed during the visit. The health information collected about you will be held by the mobile nursing company or any company acting on their behalf, such as the study site and Roche. Your health information related to mobile nursing visits will be kept under the same level of privacy used for the main study.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / “A PHASE III, MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, PARALLEL-GROUP, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF GANTENERUMAB IN PARTICIPANTS AT RISK FOR OR AT THE EARLIEST STAGES OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE” Protocol Number: WN42444 Principal Investigator: (Study Doctor) Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Telephone: (716) 323-0549 (716) 712-0380 (24-Hours) Address: UBMD Neurology, University at Buffalo Conventus Building, 4th Floor 1001 Main Street Buffalo, NY 14203 SECTION 1: STUDY OVERVIEW Note: In this Consent Form, ""you"" refers to the person being asked to participate in the study as a postdose observer. 1.1 INTRODUCTION • You are being asked to take part as a postdose observer for a participant in a research study (also called a “clinical trial”); Study WN42444. Study WN42444 evaluates whether a novel investigational treatment, gantenerumab, can prevent or slow the development of symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease in people who are at risk for or at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. • F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (hereafter referred to as “Roche”) is the Sponsor of this study and is paying the study site to cover the costs of this study. • This Consent Form tells you what will happen if you take part as a postdose observer in Study WN42444. It also tells you about the possible benefits and risks of being in the study as postdose observer. • Taking part as a postdose observer in this study is your choice. Please read the information carefully and feel free to ask questions. It may be helpful for you to discuss this information with your family and friends. • Instead of participating in this study, you may choose not to take part. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 2 of 8 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 2 Dec 2021 Revised 9 Mar 2022 • If you decide to take part as a postdose observer, you will be asked to sign and date this Consent Form. You will be given a copy of your signed and dated Consent Form. 2. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY? The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good or bad, of gantenerumab compared with placebo (inactive substance) in participants who are at risk for or at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Gantenerumab is an investigational drug, which means health authorities like the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not approved gantenerumab for the treatment or the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. While gantenerumab has been, and is being tested in participants with prodromal to mild Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in younger individuals with a familial form of the disease, it has not been tested in older participants who are at risk for or at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease prior to this study. Study WN42444 investigates whether gantenerumab can prevent or slow the development of symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease in participants who are at risk for or in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. 3. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I PARTICIPATE? Your individual participation in the study as a postdose observer will be during the study treatment period, during which the participant will receive the study drug or placebo. The study treatment period may last approximately 4 years, during which the participant will be dosed with either gantenerumab or placebo. The participant will have a 50% chance of receiving gantenerumab. A placebo looks like a drug but has no active ingredient. The assignment to the gantenerumab or the placebo group will be decided by chance (like tossing a coin). Neither you, the participant, the study partner, or the study doctor can know the group the participant is in. However, the study doctor can find out which group the participant is in, if their safety is at risk. You will be asked to observe the participant after he/she received the study drug if the study visit does not take place at the clinic and the study drug is administered by the participant or study partner as a subcutaneous injection. The injection frequency depends on the schedule the participant chooses and may be once every 2 weeks or once every week. You or another trained person (for example, the study partner) will be asked to observe the participant after each study drug administration for at least 1 hour, to watch for any side effects and ensure the safety of the participant. The side effects that you will be asked to watch for include signs or symptoms of possibly serious hypersensitivity reactions that might occur in a participant after injection such as: fever, chills, low blood pressure, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, difficulty breathing, or shock. In order to recognize signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction, you will receive training from the study doctor or another qualified study staff member. Your study doctor or another F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / Protocol Number WN42444 Page 3 of 8 Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Advarra IRB Approved Version 2 Dec 2021 Revised 9 Mar 2022 qualified study staff member will also provide you with emergency contact information to use as soon as possible if you note any such signs or symptoms in the participant. Other side effects of gantenerumab are detailed in Section 2.1 of the Main Participant Informed Consent Form. Your study doctor will provide more details on possible side effects of gantenerumab and instructions on what to do when you observe them. 4. ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS? You will not benefit directly from your participation in this study, but the study research team and other doctors may learn important new things about the treatment effects of gantenerumab on participants who are at risk for or at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. 5. ARE THERE ANY RISKS? There is currently no information available on the risk of being a postdose observer for a participant who is at risk for or at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease. 6. ARE THERE ANY SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS? For you as a postdose observer, there are certain requirements, as listed below: • Keep the schedule for postdose observation as agreed with the participant • If you cannot keep the schedule as originally planned, please contact study personnel (that is, the study doctor or study staff) as soon as possible • Inform study personnel about any symptoms that the participant develops during the postdose observation period via phone • Inform study personnel if you change your mind about participating in the study 7. WILL I BE PAID TO PARTICIPATE? You will not be compensated for taking part in this study as a postdose observer. You will be reimbursed for your reasonable costs (for example, transportation and parking) to travel from your home to the study site. Information from this study, including information from research on the participant’s samples, may lead to discoveries, inventions, or development of commercial products. You and your family will not receive any benefits or payment if this happens. 8. CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY? You can leave this study at any time. Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping, and the study doctor will tell you how to best stop your participation as a postdose observer, and if applicable, the next steps to allow the study participant to continue. 9.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd / “A PHASE III, MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, PARALLEL-GROUP, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF GANTENERUMAB IN PARTICIPANTS AT RISK FOR OR AT THE EARLIEST STAGES OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE” Protocol Number: WN42444 Principal Investigator: (Study Doctor) Kinga Szigeti, MD, PhD Telephone: (716) 323-0549 (716) 712-0380 (24-Hours) Address: UBMD Neurology, University at Buffalo Conventus Building, 4th Floor 1001 Main Street Buffalo, NY 14203 This form is for use in a research study that may involve participants who may or may not have the capacity to consent to take part in the study. When the participant cannot legally consent to take part, pronouns “you” and “your” should be read as referring to the participant rather than the person (legally authorized representative) who is signing and dating this form for the participant. In cases where the participant’s representative gives consent, the participant should be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. PURPOSE You are being asked to sign and date this form because you became pregnant after you received the gantenerumab as a research participant in a clinical study (WN42444). The risks to your infant are not known. Therefore, the study Sponsor, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (hereafter referred to as Roche), would like to collect information about your infant’s health status for study drug safety purposes. The purpose of this authorization is to inform you of how your infant’s personal health information may be used or shared with others, so that you can decide whether to allow your infant’s health information to be collected for the purposes stated in this form. If you do not sign and date this authorization, your decision will not affect your or your infant's ability to receive medical care or health benefits. F.

There will be no medical tests, procedures, or study visits as part of your infant’s participation in this follow-up. RISKS Because your participation in this follow-up activity will involve no medical treatments or procedures, there is no medical or physical risk to you or your infant associated with your participation. While every effort will be made to safeguard your infant’s personal information, there is a small risk that your infant’s information may be inappropriately disclosed. For this reason, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION You will not receive any monetary compensation for participation in this follow-up activity. COSTS There will be no charge to you, your partner, or your insurance company for participation in this follow-up. NEW FINDINGS Any new important information that is discovered during the study and which may influence your willingness to continue your infant’s participation in the follow-up will be provided to you. BENEFITS There is no direct benefit to your infant from your infant’s participation in the follow-up. Information learned from the study may help other people in the future. Please note that your infant’s participation in this follow-up does not replace medical care that they would ordinarily receive from a pediatrician. ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION This infant information follow up is for research purposes only. The only alternative is to not participate. AUTHORIZED HEALTH INFORMATION If you sign and date this form, you give permission to your infant's doctors and other health care providers to use and/or share your infant's health information for purposes of learning more about the safety of F.

This consent form explains the research study. Please read it carefully. Ask questions about anything you do not understand. If you do not have questions now, you may still ask later. If you have any questions about your rights as a participant in a research project, you should contact (anonymously, if you wish) the Social and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board at 516 Capen Hall, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260, by phone at (716) 645-6474 or by e-mail at sbsirb@research.buffalo.edu. JOINING OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL (VOLUNTEERING FOR THE STUDY): Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. You have the right to refuse to allow access to particular course evaluation materials. You also have the right to withdraw your own data at the end of the session or later. Your refusal to participate will not affect your training or certification as a Cultural Health Broker or any other participation in Erie Niagara AHEC programs. PURPOSE: You are invited to participate in research regarding the process and success of Cultural Health Broker training. As EN AHEC works to create an effective and sustainable program, it is important to evaluate it along the way to determine what is working and what does not. Your input is very important in this process. PROCEDURES: No time outside of your training will be required for this study. We ask that you allow access to de-identified copies of your pre-interview survey, your pre-test, each of the module quizzes/assessments, and the post-test/program evaluation. We will analyze these to determine if the curriculum is effective, if there is change in knowledge before and after training, and if the cultural health broker trainees are generally satisfied with the process. Additionally, we would like to review segments of de-identified transcripts from the community conversations that you will conduct upon completing the cultural health broker training. This will help us evaluate how the community perceives the usefulness of cultural health brokers. TIME COMMITTMENT: No time outside of your training will be required for this study. RISKS AND BENEFITS: There is a risk of breach of confidentiality and loss of privacy. To protect you from the risk of loss of privacy related to your training information, your course instructors will photocopy your completed evaluation forms, blacken out your name and any other identifying information, mark the form with a unique identification number assigned randomly to you and provide those forms to us, the researchers. Thus, your name will not appear in the data we analyze. The master list linking your data to your name will be kept by the course instructors and destroyed once the data has been properly entered into a database. You may benefit from this research by contributing to the development of a replicable cultural health broker training program. CONFIDENTIALITY: Your privacy will be maintained at all times during and after the study, including in all published and written reports resulting from this study. Information about your identity (last name, address, etc.) will not be known by the researchers and thus will not be entered into the database for analysis. The master list held by the instructors that links the data to your name will be destroyed on or before the IRB expiration date for the study. No other personal record will be collected. Your identity will not be revealed at any point throughout this study. PAYMENT: Outside of the compensation you are receiving as a cultural health broker trainee, you will receive no additional monetary payment for your participation in this study. PARTICIPANT STATEMENT: I’ve read the explanation provided to me. I’ve had all of my questions answered to my satisfaction, and I voluntarily agree to participate in this study. I’ve been given a copy of this consent form. SIGNATURE OF PARTICIPANT and DATE: ____________________________________________________________________________ I certify that I obtained the consent of the subject whose signature is above. I understand that I must give a signed copy of the informed consent form to the subject, and keep the original copy in my files for 3 years after the completion of the research project.

Elders are then provided with digital devices and internet connectivity (tablets and Wi-Fi hotspots) and training customized to their digital and health literacy needs over a course of six months. 10 lessons teaching the basics of digital and health literacy are implemented, but trainers regularly set aside time to answer elder’s questions about how to use their devices in ways they are interested. Outcomes are assessed with pre/post surveys. The first cohort of participants are members of the Canopy of Neighbors, a Western New York (WNY) elder village that helps elders age independently. The second cohort of participants are from an East-Buffalo church. 100% of study participants reside in the poorest zip codes of WNY. - Results/Anticipated Results: 700 characters (333) Preliminary results show an increase in elders’ digital and health literacies. Of the first cohort, 100% of users learned basic skills and report feeling more comfortable/confident using a digital device. 56% of users used their hotspots (the remaining participants reside in an apartment building that provides WiFi). 89% of participants now utilize their device to access patient portals. - Discussion/Significance of Impact: 300 characters (300) This pilot will allow for subsequent proposals with an expansion of the program to include students and Community Health Workers (CHWs) as trainers and the creation of an app that will allow users to have health vitals analyzed with Binah.ai technology, report symptoms and questions to a chatbot and CHWs and provide users with a simplified patient portal. - Lay Summary Primary Funding: Western New York Digital Equity Coalition Please describe: The UB CTSI and the Special Populations Core maintains a membership in the Western New York Digital Equity Coalition, a coalition of 60+ organizations across non-profit agencies, businesses, philanthropic organizations, higher education institutions, school districts, local governments, and libraries in WNY with a goal of improving digital inclusion and equity for all.

More than 1 in 4 people with diabetes do no know that they have the disease. People with diabetes have high blood sugar (a.k.a. glucose) levels due to the fact that insulin, a hormone that helps keeping blood sugars in check, is low or does not work well. This is called insulin resistance. A common physical sign of insulin resistance is a darkening of the skin over the neck and other skin folds. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include: increased thirst and urination, and an “unexpected” weight loss (i.e., a weight loss that is not due to improved diet and exercise). Blood sugar can be measured at the doctor’s office with a very small drop of blood via a finger prick utilizing a small device called a glucose meter. These inexpensive small devices are also called home blood sugar monitors because they can be used very easily at home. If somebody is diagnosed with diabetes and therapy has started, there are also sugar sensors. These look like a small “button” that is applied without pain in a few seconds over the arm and can measure blood sugar near continuously without finger pricks. Pre-diabetes affects 1 in 3 adults in the U.S. As the word implies, pre-diabetes precedes diabetes. Blood sugars are higher than normal but not as high as in diabetes. More than 8 out of 10 adults who have pre-diabetes do not know they have pre-diabetes. This is too bad because the progression from pre-diabetes do diabetes can be stopped with lifestyle changes. On the other hand if blood sugars stay high they can cause serious health issues, such as eye, kidney and heart disease. People with overweight and obesity are at higher risk for pre-diabetes and diabetes. The Body Mass Index (BMI) table below helps estimate overweight and obesity. Find your height on the left vertical grey bar and your weight on the top horizontal grey bar. Follow them to the square where they “meet” and that is your BMI. The following blood tests, easily done with a finger stick and readily available to all, are done to check if a person has normal sugar levels or levels that are diagnostic of pre-diabetes or diabetes: • HbA1C: Hemoglobin (Hb) is the protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen. Besides oxygen, sugar can also “stick” to the hemoglobin. Hemoglobin A1c measures the percentage of hemoglobin that has sugar “stuck” to it. The percentage is higher when the sugar has been higher. Based on the life span of red blood cells that carry hemoglobin, HbA1c reflects the “average” of sugar levels over a 3-month period. • Fasting Sugar: Done after the person has not had anything to eat or drink EXCEPT water for at least 8 hours prior to the check (usually first thing in the morning). 2022 American Diabetes Association: Criteria for Diabetes Diagnosis Hemoglobin A1c Fasting Blood Sugar Normal < 5.7% < 100 mg/dl Pre-diabetes 5.7 – 6.4% 100-125 mg/dl Diabetes ≥ 6.5% ≥ 126 mg/dl NOTE: A random (done at any time during the day) blood test showing sugar > 200 mg/dl WITH classic symptoms of diabetes can also be used for diagnosis. 2022 American Diabetes Association Recommendations SCREENING for PRE-DIABETES & DIABETES in ADULTS Without Symptoms of Diabetes If results are normal, repeat test at 3-year intervals or more frequently based on risk status 1. Test adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 25) or BMI ≥ 23 in Asian Americans who have 1 or more following risk factors: • First degree relative with diabetes • High Risk race/ethnicity (i.e., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander) • History of cardiovascular disease • History of Diabetes during pregnancy (repeat test at least every 3 years) • People with HIV before starting & during antiretroviral therapy. If sugar normal, check yearly. • High blood pressure 140/90 or on therapy for high blood pressure • HDL Cholesterol ≤ 35 mg/dl or triglyceride ≥ 250 mg/dl • Prediabetes: A1c ≥ 5.7% or Impaired Fasting Glucose (test yearly) • Other clinical conditions associated with diabetes insulin resistance (elevated BMI, darkening of the skin on the neck, armpits, or skin-fold areas, Polycystic ovary syndrome) 2. Women who had diabetes during pregnancy 3.

Other,MIND_Recruitment_Materials,"60 MIND Key Messages MIND STUDY KEY MESSAGES How are these messages used? Developing an agreed upon a set of brief, core study recruitment messages is an essential aspect of an effective communications strategy for the MIND Study. The messages that follow are intentionally written with a diverse consumer audience in mind with the difficult science translated into understandable terms. The first four messages have been previously approved and used for the study. The last message regarding diversity is new but uses similar language to approved diversity messaging from AHEAD. The messages serve as a foundational guide for drafting additional recruitment and retention materials. They remind the communicators of the key agreed upon points that study leadership has developed in an effort to achieve success in recruiting a diverse, motivated, and representative sample. Messages are intended to be motivating, timely and updated as needed. These key points can help messengers cut through the clutter and tell the story using a consistent vocabulary. Why? Because many messengers repeating the same messages maximizes impact. MEMORY LOSS IS NOT NORMAL Many people mistakenly believe memory loss is a normal part of aging. • Memory loss associated with aging can be mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, a potential precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. o Alzheimer’s starts 15 to 20 years before any outward symptoms of dementia, and Alzheimer’s-like changes can be seen in the brain of patients experiencing mild memory loss. • MCI causes changes to memory and attention that are serious enough to be noticed by the people experiencing them and to family and friends who see them often. o Signs of MCI include: losing things often; forgetting to go to appointments; or having trouble coming up with the right words. • Though many don’t know it, nearly one in six adults over the age of 60 are living with MCI and 10 to 15 percent of individuals with MCI go on to develop dementia. 61 NIH-SUPPORTED STUDY EXPLORES USING NICOTINE FOR MEMORY LOSS Funded by the National Institutes of Health, the MIND Study is testing whether the use of nicotine, delivered via a patch, can safely improve memory and functioning in people with mild memory loss. • Researchers have used nicotine in memory studies for more than 30 years and the MIND Study is by far the largest and longest-running study of its kind. • Researchers have long known that nicotine stimulates systems in the brain which are important for thinking and memory. o When not associated with smoking, researchers believe nicotine can stimulate systems for memory and attention in the brain. • MIND Study researchers use the potential benefits of nicotine to test whether they can improve or alleviate symptoms of memory loss in people who have MCI, and possibly delay or prevent progression to Alzheimer’s disease. • If effective, nicotine could significantly improve the treatment options for MCI, because it is inexpensive, naturally occurring and readily available. • In addition to the NIH, the MIND Study is funded by the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation and led by researchers at Vanderbilt University and the University of Southern California’s Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute. NICOTINE DOES NOT CAUSE CANCER We all know the dangers of smoking, but nicotine does not cause cancer. The tar and thousands of other chemicals found in cigarettes are what make smokers susceptible to cancer, heart disease and respiratory illness. • Fifty years of public health messaging has been instrumental in helping people understand that smoking may cause cancer and in reducing smoking rates nationwide. o What’s been overshadowed or lost in that messaging is that nicotine may have medicinal benefits. • Nicotine can be safe when used as directed by your physician. • The nicotine patch is an evidence-based therapy for smoking cessation, but researchers believe it could be used to treat other conditions, like memory loss, mental illness, and Parkinson’s disease. WE NEED VOLUNTEERS FOR THIS CLINICAL STUDY Help us find treatment for people experiencing mild memory loss. We need non-smoking adults over the age of 55 who are in the earliest stages of memory loss, or MCI, to participate in the MIND Study. • You may be eligible to participate if you have been diagnosed with MCI or if you or your family members have noticed changes in your memory. For example: 62 o Are you or a loved one having difficulty remembering recent events? Have you noticed recent changes in your memory or your loved one’s memory? o Has your memory changed in the last two years? If you asked someone close to you about your memory, what would they say? • MIND Study participants will: o Have their memory evaluated to determine eligibility for the Study; o Wear a daily nicotine patch during waking hours; o Have a family member or close friend serve as a Study Partner who accompanies them to select visits and provides the research staff feedback about the participant’s memory; and o Go to an appointment every three months for up to two years. • The MIND Study has more than 30 research sites in cities across the country where people can volunteer. • Researchers and doctors are always looking for better treatments for Alzheimer’s and other memory loss. The only way to test potential treatments is through clinical trials. o It is especially important for those at higher risk, such as Black and African Americans, to be included in clinical trials. • The MIND Study is actively recruiting volunteers to participate in this groundbreaking study that offers a potential treatment to mild memory loss. • Volunteers receive $50 per visit and no-cost treatment patches, and, depending on the study location, volunteers may be reimbursed for travel to study visits. • If you are a healthy, non-smoking adult age 55 or older, please visit MINDStudy.org or call 866-MIND-150 to learn more. HELP YOURSELF, YOUR FAMILY, AND GENERATIONS TO COME The MIND Study needs participants of every race and ethnicity to help find an affordable, potential treatment for mild memory loss. • There are racial and ethnic disparities in Alzheimer’s disease and related memory loss disorders like mild cognitive impairment. o Black and African Americans are twice as likely to develop MCI as compared to White adults. o One in 10 Hispanic adults are likely to develop MCI. • More research is needed to understand whether potential memory loss treatments will work for everyone or why treatments may work better for specific populations. • The only avenue to test potential treatments is through clinical trials. o However, those most at-risk, Black and African Americans and Hispanics and Latinos, are underrepresented in clinical trials, limiting the understanding how potential treatments work in these communities. ▪ Black and African Americans make up less than 5 percent of most Alzheimer’s clinical trials. 63 ▪ Hispanics and Latinos make up less than 5 percent of most Alzheimer’s clinical trials. o Past abuse and misconduct of Black people in clinical trials has resulted in people of color not participating in potential life-changing trials. ▪ Diagnoses, prevention, and understanding of memory loss are not based on the lived experiences of Black people due to the underrepresentation of Black individuals in clinical trials. This must stop. • The MIND Study urges Black and Hispanic adults to participate in clinical research so that potential therapies are developed with the most at-risk communities involved. • Help yourself and future generations gain access to potential treatments for mild memory loss by joining the MIND Study at www.MINDstudy.org. 64 MIND Study Digital Ad Copy Options Facebook and Google Mix and Match Ad Copy Options For local IRBs that do not require specific text pairings.

Abstracts & Posters,Brian Train abstract,"Allison Case, RN ajg46@buffalo.edu Brain Train: Educational Intervention and Its Effects on Barriers to Clinical Trial Participation in Alzheimer’s Disease Studies by Underrepresented Communities Kinga Szigeti, MD, Phd University at Buffalo, University Neurology Allison Case, RN University at Buffalo, University Neurology Up until recently, with the controversial release of Aduhelm, the last FDA approved Alzheimer’s Disease drug entered the market in 2002. Recruitment and participation have been noted as barriers to further drug development. Minority populations are under represented in clinical trials despite experiencing a larger burden of the disease. (Percentages of adults aged 65+ with AD by race/ethnicity; 14% African American, 12% Hispanic, 10% non-Hispanic Whites) Brain Train was created as an educational intervention about clinical research to increase minority population interest in participating in Alzheimer’s Disease focused clinical trials. Brain Train is a 30-minute-long educational program about Alzheimer’s Disease that is presented to diverse communities with the participants of at least 50 years of age throughout Western New York. The presentation itself is divided into three segments; healthy aging brain and lifestyle recommendations, the importance of early diagnosis, and a randomized segment about clinical trial process, risks and benefits. The study utilizes the cluster randomization method to allocate intervention groups and control groups. At the beginning of the presentation, participating individuals are asked questions about their knowledge of Alzheimer’s Disease, how they feel about research participation and research in general. After completing the presentation, participants are then asked follow up questions; how likely they would be to participate in research, etc. Upon completion of the pilot presentations some interesting data was revealed. Of the people that were surveyed it was determined that education does not appear to be sufficient enough to increase clinical trial enrollment for underrepresented populations. Trust seems to be the most significant barrier among African American participants. Trust building strategies should be explored to answer the research question. The data was limited by lack of diversity in sample and participants not answering every question. Encouraging unrepresented populations to participate in clinical research is important. Their participation could increase the number of Alzheimer’s Disease medications on the market with increased participation. Also, with better data and more populations represented could produce more effective Alzheimer’s Medications."

Other,Digital Divide Study FAQs,"Digital Divide Project Frequently Asked Questions Why am I being invited to take part in a research study? The University at Buffalo and Canopy of Neighbors are partnering to help close the “Digital Divide,” the gap between people who have access to modern information and technology and the means to use it, and those who do not. We are seeking to empower elders with digital literacy and access to tools and knowledge. What should I know about a research study? • Someone will explain this research study to you. • Whether or not you take part is up to you. • You can choose not to take part. • You can agree to take part and later change your mind. • Your decision will not be held against you. • You can ask all the questions you want before you decide. Why is this research being done? During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine and health digital access provided an infrastructure that helped those who had the knowledge and financial means to access it. In fact, digital access to health and digital heath literacy proved to be major barriers for elders. Older adults are at a higher risk for digital inequity for a variety of reasons, including cost- associated factors, and a lack of adequate resources for learning digital literacy. We are doing this study to help combat the digital divide and to provide elders with the opportunity to empower themselves with digital literacy in order to live better-connected lifestyles and make better-informed decisions with health care. How long will the research last and what will I need to do? This study will last for approximately 8 months. You will participate in an informal discussion about digital access and your digital and health needs. You will then fill out a short survey. After that, we will provide you with a tablet and training on how to use it. We will also provide you with a wifi hotspot (if you need it) in order to access the internet. After 6 months of training and internet access, the wifi hotspot will be deactivated (however, you can keep your tablet at no cost to you), and you will take one final survey. Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me? This study has no foreseeable risks associated with it. Any data or information we collect from you will be completely anonymous. The only data and information we are collecting is the information you provide us in the interview and in the surveys. Will being in this study help me in any way? Yes! We will provide you with a tablet and wifi access as well as training on how to use your device, digital healthcare like patient portals and telehealth visits, Zoom, Youtube, and more! What happens if I do not want to be in this research? You do not have to participate in this research study. Not participating in this study will not affect your standing with Canopy of Neighbors or the University at Buffalo. You can stop participating at any time. Who can I talk to? If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think the research has hurt you, talk to the research team at 716-465-9131 or via email at awstrohm@buffalo.edu. You may also contact the research participant advocate at 716-888-4845 or researchadvocate@buffalo.edu. This research has been reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). An IRB is a committee that provides ethical and regulatory oversight of research that involves human subjects. You may talk to them at (716) 888-4888 or email ub-irb@buffalo.edu if: • You have questions about your rights as a participant in this research • Your questions, concerns, or complaints are not being answered by the research team. • You cannot reach the research team. • You want to talk to someone besides the research team. • You want to get information or provide input about this research. How many people will be studied? We are starting the study with a group of 10 people. We will further expand the study at a later date to 20-25+. What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research? University at Buffalo study staff will reach out to you shortly to schedule a time for the informal interview. After that, they will be in contact regarding giving you your digital devices and setting up times for training. What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later? You can leave the research at any time. It will not be held against you. What happens to the information collected for the research? All information collected in this study will be de-identified and completely anonymous. Who is paying for this research? A grant for this study was provided by the Western New York Digital Equity Coalition."
